        <h2>J-POP</h2>
        <p>J-Pop songs tend to be more creative with their chord progressions than western songs. Most western songs have the I-V-VI-IV or VI-V-I-IV pattern. They follow this pattern throughout the song making the same pop-punk or sad loop. J-POP on the other hand usually follows  the IV-V-III-VI chord progression with different key changes and harder chord sequences throughout the song. These sometimes change every beat or syllable. This makes it more fun for me to play japanese songs on the piano and bass guitar.</p>
        <h2>Vocaloid</h2>
        <p>Vocaloid is a genre of Japanese music where they use a voice synthesizer software. They create music by typing lyrics and melodies to sound realistic or stylized singing. One of my favorite vocaloid singers is Hatsune Miku. Her synthesized voice is high pitched and is very recognizable from other vocaloids.</p>
        <h2>J-ROCK</h2>
        <p>I love J-Rock songs because they make very complex guitar riffs and bass guitar lines. Although I can't play most of them, they mostly still follow the J-POP chord progression.</p>
