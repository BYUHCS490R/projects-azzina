            <p>Valorant is a first-person shooter game released in 2020. Its a free-to-play game and was developed by Riot Games. The game is a tactical shooter 5v5 where teams buy their gun and ability loadout every round. It gets its inspiration from the popular game Counter Strike as they both have the same victory goal: To plant the bomb or spike for attackers, and to defuse the bomb or eliminate the enemy team for defenders.</p>
            <p>There are different characters or agents to play in Valorant, and each one has their own roles. Duelists usually take on the fights first. Initiators use their special kit to initiate gunfights. Controllers can smoke parts of the map off to block the enemy's view. Sentinels can lock down a bombsite to prevent enemies from entering it. This website focuses more on the duelists.</p>
