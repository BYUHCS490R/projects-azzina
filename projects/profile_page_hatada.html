    <h1>Aloha! I'm Zeph</h1>
    <p>My name is Zeph, but you can also call me Kentaro. I have a really big background of where I'm from so sit tight. I'm a Brazilian from Japan who has also lived in the Philippines. My dad is half Japanese, half Brazilian from Brazil, and my mom is Japanese/Filipino from the Philippines. I served a mission in the Philippines Bacolod Mission. Because of that background, I can speak 5 languages namely: English, Japanese, Tagalog, Hiligaynon, and Cebuano.</p>
    <p>I'm an athletic swimmer, so I go to the pool and train in the gym a lot. I also like going on runs with my friends. I've been playing the piano since I was younger, and I also played the bass guitar in highschool. On my free time, I'd be listening to K-pop or J-pop while playing games on my laptop.</p>
    <p>My favorite food are:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Udon</li>
        <li>Strawberries</li>
        <li><mark>Dark Chocolate</mark></li>
        <li>Shrimp</li>
    </ol>
