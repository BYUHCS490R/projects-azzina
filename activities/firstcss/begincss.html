        <p>1. Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.<br>Inline CSS is where you can change the style inside a specific tag. Embedded CSS makes you change the style from the head tag of the HTML file. This can also make you change the style of every same tag in the website. External CSS links your website to a different .css file its style.</p>
        <p>2. Explain why you should only use external CSS.<br> We should only use external CSS because in a team, you will have different members in charge of different files. If someone is using inline css, the one incharge of external css can not override it. Another reason is if we use different pages, you can use one css file for all of the websites to have the same style.</p>
        <p>3. What is a selector used for?<br>A selector is used to select a specific HTML tag or element to change its style using CSS.</p>
