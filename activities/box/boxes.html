        <p>1. What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?<br>Block tags are elements that start on a new line and their height and width can be set. Inline tags do not start on a new line and their height and width cant be changed.</p>
        <p>2. What is the margin, border, and padding?<br>The margin is the space outside the element border. The border is the very edge of the element inbetween the margin and the padding and can also be styled. The padding is the space between the content and the border.</p>
        <p>3. What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?<br>There are fixed and relative measurements. Fixed measurements are pixels, cm, and inches. Relative measurements are percentage, em, and rem.</p>
        <p>4. When would you use a figure tag?<br>You can use it with a picture inside to make it a box model to style it. You also use it with the figcaption tag.</p>
