        <ul>
            <li>Link to an outside website with an absolute link. <br>heres a <a href="https://www.byuh.edu">link</a></li>
            <li>What is the root? What is the relationship between folder and file names and the path?<br>The root is the topmost or starting directory of all the files. The path is the sequence in the directory between the folders where you can locate a specific file. It is separated by a slash</li>
            <li>What is a default document?<br>The default document is the specific file that a web server sends to your browser when a URL doesnt specify a file name.</li>
            <li>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?<br>An absolute link provides the complete web address including the protocol and domain name. A relative link is only a partial path that directs you to a page relative to your current page. You would use relative links because it brings you to another page in your own directory instead of linking to a different page.</li>
            <li>Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).<br> heres a <a href="/projects-azzina/activities/structuraltags.html">link</a></li>
            <li>List the 3 rules with relative links.<br>To link a file in the same folder, you can use the file name. To link to a file in a subfolder, use the subfolders name followed by a slash and the file name. To link to a file in a parent folder, use ../ to move up one directory.</li>
            <li>Link to your last project.<br>heres a <a href="/projects-azzina/projects/profile_page_hatada.html">link</a></li>
            <li>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?<br>no</li>
