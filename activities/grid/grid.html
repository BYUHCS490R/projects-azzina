        <p>1. Please describe the parent-child relationship in HTML and why it becomes essential when using flex and grid.<br>The parent-child relationship in html creates something like a hierarchy. Its essential in using flex and grid because every child within the parent gets the same attributes. Every outer element is the parent of the elements within it. This can be more clearly seen when the code is properly tabbed. Different properties can also be assigned to the parent which cant be assigned to the child.</p>
        <p>2. What are the two main differences between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?<br>The two main differences are in their dimensions and how content is arranged. Flex is a one dimensional layout, while grid is a two dimensional layout. The content in a flex is arranged according to what comes in first, while content in a grid has predefined rows and columns where the content goes.</p>
