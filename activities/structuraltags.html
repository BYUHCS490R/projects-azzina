            <li>What goes in the header?<br>The header tag contains introductory content like the logo for the website or the nav tag.</li>
            <li>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?<br>Different links go in the nav tag. Yes, the nav tag can go in the header, but it does not need to be in the header, it can go before or after it as well. The nav contains other links to your own websites, not another website.</li>
            <li>What goes in Main?<br>The main unique content of the website goes in the main tag.</li>
            <li>What goes in the Footer?<br>The footer tag is seen at the very end of the page, and usually contains copyright information, contact details/links, and other resources related to the webpage.</li>
