        <p>1. List out the different ways to select an item.<br>You can select items via tag name, descendants or children rule, their ID #, and their class.</p>
        <p>2. What is the difference between an ID and a Class?<br>An ID is more specific than a class. An ID cannot be reused and is only on one specific item. A class can be used more than once on different items. The class uses a period, and the ID uses a hashtag. You can also have multiple classes on an item.</p>
        <p>3. What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?<br>A DIV is an inline-block spaced item, and a SPAN is an inline spaced item. A DIV can group paragraphs together, while a SPAN is usually for words in a sentence.</p>
        <p>4. What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?<br>A div tag functions just like the other tags except the header, main, and footer tags are semantic. This means they clearly explain what they do. A div is just like an imaginary box.</p>
        <p>5. What are the different ways to select a color?<br>You can use the color name, RGB, Hex Code, and Short Hex Code.</p>
